**The electronic rosary program for Muslims aims to glorify God Almighty by providing many features within the application such as:**
- The rosary will always be with you.
- Transferable from site to application through site based on browser engine through **PWA** technology provided by **Google**.
- The rosary is able to work through the Internet and also works without the Internet, as it depends on storing site files in the browser using the **cache first** method.
- The rosary works to save all the entries automatically and is not deleted by closing the application so that the data is not deleted by mistake.
- The rosary has more than one different vibration mode to use the rosary without the need to look at the mobile.
- You can delete all the data through a dedicated button that has a different vibration pattern.
